				<div class="container">
					<p>
						We present iLeakage, a transient execution side channel attack targeting <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon">Apple Silicon CPUs</a> running the <a
							href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari web browser</a> on macOS or iOS. Apple has
						degraded the timer resolution for their CPUs at the OS level, and even more so in Safari.
						Furthermore, Apple has introduced measures in Safari to prevent unauthorized reads from its full
						address space even in the face of <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre attacks</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In spite of this, we show it is possible for malicious JavaScript and WebAssembly hosted on any
						webpage to recover sensitive information from a target webpage. These targets include popular
						online services such as someone's Gmail inbox or text messages on an Android phone connected
						with Google Messages. In addition, when the target uses a credential manager with autofill, we
						show iLeakage can recover login credentials.

									Most computer bugs arise from mistakes in programming, such as missing bounds checks

									Systems can leak sensitive data through sound, electromagnetic radiation, or thermal
									throttling, just for a few examples.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many side channels, including ones we use for iLeakage, comes from the CPU's cache.
									The cache is a fast but small piece of memory which stores recently used data to
									speed up repeated accesses. Notwithstanding the performance benefits, one can infer
									if a target program has used that data by measuring the time to access it.
									Accordingly, researchers have used cache side channels as a building block for
									several transient execution attacks such as Spectre. In turn, iLeakage uses Spectre
									as a building block.

								<p>
									Virtually all modern CPUs use a performance optimization where they predict if a
									branch instruction will be taken or not, should the outcome not be readily
									available. Once a prediction is made, the CPU will execute instructions along the
									prediction, a process called speculative execution. If the CPU realizes it had
									mispredicted, it must revert all changes in the state it performed after the
									prediction. Both desktop and mobile CPUs exhibit this behavior, regardless of
									manufacturer (such as Apple, AMD, or Intel).
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> is a hardware vulnerability in
									virtually all modern CPUs that occurs when speculative execution backfires. While
									the CPU should ideally revert all changes in state, speculative execution leaves
									traces in the CPU's microarchitectural state and especially the cache. A Spectre
									attack coerces the CPU into speculatively executing the wrong flow of instructions.
									If this wrong flow has instructions depending on sensitive data, their value can be
									inferred through a side channel even after the CPU realizes the mistake and reverts
									its changes. An adversary can abuse this behavior to read data that they cannot
									normally access through program semantics. Because speculative execution is an
									important part of CPU performance that is infeasible to simply remove as a
									countermeasure, Spectre continues to be dangerous to software even years after its
									discovery.

									Focusing on the fact that web browsers already provide a sandboxed environment for
									code execution, Apple has deployed countermeasures which do not thwart Spectre
									itself (because Spectre is a hardware problem), but make its weaponization for
									recovering secret data more difficult. Safari will normally put each tab into their
									own process, where Spectre cannot cross process boundaries. In addition, while
									high-resolution timers facilitate the inference of whether data are cached or not
									(for a cache side channel), they have been removed from browser environments. Safari
									also uses 35-bit addressing and poisoning techniques to prevent an attacker from
									crafting their own pointer and from reading its entire (64-bit) address space.
								</p>
								<p>
									With iLeakage, we demonstrate these countermeasures are still insufficient against
									Spectre-based attacks in the browser. We introduce a new method to coerce Safari to
									have one process render more than one webpage. Then, we bypass the poisoning
									technique by exploiting a performance optimization where Safari changes other data
									instead of our fake pointer. We also bypass the 35-bit addressing scheme with a
									speculative type confusion attack. More specifically, we induce Safari's JavaScript
									engine to run a function for one datatype on a maliciously crafted datatype while
									the CPU is performing speculative execution. This function contains a 64-bit read,
									allowing us to read all of the address space. Finally, we devise a novel
									microarchitectural primitive to distinguish cache hits from misses despite having a
									coarse timer. Combining all of this, we show end-to-end attacks on popular websites.

									However, iOS has a different situation. Due to Apple's App Store and sandboxing

									For Gmail, Google's login page and Messages by Google, our paper uses them as
									targets since they are high-value targets that contain sensitive information and are
									used by billions of users worldwide. We clarify that we did not discover any
									vulnerabilities in each website or Google's services. Furthermore, iLeakage itself
									can target nearly any website to recover data, and only exploits weaknesses we found
									in the Safari browser to do so. Thus, we do not intend to discourage users from
									using Google's services.

								<p>
									On the other hand, as we mentioned in Section 6 of the paper, we use LastPass as the
									credential manager for our evaluation due to its tendency to autofill credentials
									without user interaction once the user has manually opted to autofill them. This is
									in contrast to Safari's built-in password manager and other third-party managers
