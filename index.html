						We present iLeakage, a transient execution side channel attack targeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon">Apple Silicon CPUs</a> running the <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari web browser</a> on macOS or iOS. Apple has degraded the timer resolution for their CPUs at the OS level, and even more so in Safari. Furthermore, Apple has introduced measures in Safari to prevent unauthorized reads from its full address space even in the face of <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre attacks</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In spite of this, we show it is possible for malicious JavaScript and WebAssembly hosted on any webpage to recover sensitive information from a target webpage. These targets include popular online services such as someone's Gmail inbox or their search history on Amazon.com. In addition, when the target uses a credential manager with autofill, we show iLeakage can recover login credentials.

						We deployed Spook.js on a Tumblr blog, targeting a password that was autofilled into Tumblr's
						login page by Chrome's built-in credential manager. We show that our blog can be rendered by the
						same Chrome process as the login page, and that Spook.js can consequently recover the password.

						This time, we packaged Spook.js as a Chrome extension. We show that under certain conditions,

									The majority of attacks on computer systems take advantage of vulnerabilities in the
									algorithms they use. For example, they exploit bugs, buffer overflows or bad random number generators in order to break the security of the targeted system. 
									In contrast, a side channel attack leverages the hardware of the system in order to attack it. Common side channel examples include monitoring the system's power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, and even sound.
								</p>
								<p>
								 One popular source of side channels (which we also use for Spook.js) is the processor's cache. The cache is a hardware component which stores recently used data in memory to
									provide faster access. Although this speeds up performance, an attacker can measure the time it takes to retrieve certain data and thus infer if another program has accessed it. This allows the attacker to retrieve the target's memory access pattern, which in many cases is highly correlated with the data processed by the target. Finally, cache side channels are useful as a building block in speculative and transient execution attacks, such as Spook.js, Spectre and Meltdown.

									<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> is a hardware vulnerability that
									affects nearly every general purpose processor. This includes nearly all modern
									Intel, AMD, and Apple CPUs, both for desktops and laptops. At a high level, the
									majority of recent processors predict the outcome of a branch if it cannot be
									computed quickly, and continue executing instructions along the prediction. If the
									prediction is incorrect, the processor must roll back the instructions it executed
									speculatively, alongside any state changes incurred by these instructions.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, speculative execution leaves traces in the CPU's microarchitectural state,
									notably in the cache. Thus, a Spectre attacker might confuse the CPU's branch
									predictor into incorrectly executing instructions that should not have been executed
									otherwise. In case this incorrect speculation operates over private data, it is
									possible to leak the data via a side channel thus allowing attackers to read data
									otherwise inaccessible to them. In particular, in case a suitable Spectre-vulnerable
									code pattern (gadget) is present in a process belonging to a targeted program, an
									attacker might abuse this gadget in order to recover the contents of the process's
									entire address space and the data within it. Being a fundamental issue with
									speculative execution, Spectre is a threat to nearly all software, ranging from the
									computer's operating system to the web browser.

								</p>
								<p>
									Strict Site Isolation is a recent browser architecture aimed at increasing browser
									security. Rather then arbitrarily assign different websites into different
									processes, browsers with Strict Site Isolation enabled ensure that content from
									different websites will be located in different processes. For example, data
									pertaining to google.com will never share the same process as the data for

									eTLD+1 is an acronym for effective top-level domain plus one. A top-level domain
									(TLD) is the part of a domain name without dots, such as "com", "org", or "edu".
									Users can register domain names under a TLD, like "example.com".
									On the other hand, an effective top-level domain (eTLD) contains dots and is
									therefore not a true TLD, but is the part of a domain name under which subdomains
									can be registered directly. An example is "edu.au", with "adelaide.edu.au" registered under it.
								</p>
								<p>
									The +1 refers to the term that comes just before the TLD or eTLD, delimited
									by a dot. That is, for "example.com" it is "example", and for "adelaide.edu.au" it
									is "adelaide". If two websites share a TLD or eTLD as well as the term preceding it,
									Chrome might consolidate them into the same process, despite Strict Site Isolation.
									Thus, Chrome will separate "example.com" and "example.net" due to different TLDs, and also
									"example.com" and "attacker.com" because the +1 terms (preceding the TLD) are different.
									However, "attacker.example.com" and "corporate.example.com" are allowed to share the same
									process due to their common eTLD+1 of "example.com". This allows pages hosted under "attacker.example.com"
									to potentially extract information from pages under "corporate.example.com".

									Spectre is fundamentally a hardware vulnerability where footprints of speculative
									execution are not cleaned up completely within the processor's state. Thus, Strict Site
									Isolation cannot fix Spectre. Instead, Strict Site Isolation attempts to limit
									information leakage by separating
									the contents of different websites into different processes.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, there are certain conditions under which Chrome does not separate two
									websites. The most prominent is the case where two websites sharing an eTLD+1 domain
									are opened in separate tabs, while the system is already under memory pressure from
									other tabs being open. In our paper, we identified several services which host
									attacker-controlled JavaScript code on the same eTLD+1 domain as a page containing
									sensitive information, such as the service's login page. In this example, in case
									the user opens a page hosting Spook.js attack code in parallel to the service's login
									page, Chrome's Strict Site Isolation implementation consolidates these two pages
									into the same process. This then allows our attack to extract the user's
									credentials as these are being autofilled by the browser's credential manager.

									Since Spectre's original introduction in 2018, browser vendors have deployed many
									countermeasures in order to make Spectre harder to exploit. In addition to Strict
									Site Isolation, which prevets different webpages from sharing the same process,
									Chrome also partitions the address space of each process into different 32-bit
									sandboxes (despite being a 64-bit application). Limiting all values to be 32-bit
									prevents a Spectre attacker from crossing partition boundaries, thus further
									limiting information exposure.
								</p>

									Spook.js shows that these countermeasures are insufficient in order to protect users
									from browser-based speculative execution attacks. More specifically, we show that
									Chrome's Strict Site Isolation implementation consolidates webpages based on their
									eTLD+1 domain, allowing an attacker-controlled page to extract sensitive information
									from pages on other subdomains. Next, we also show how to bypass
									Chrome's 32-bit sandboxing mechanism. We achieve this by using a type confusion
									attack, which temporarily forces Chrome's JavaScript execution engine to operate on
									an object of the wrong type. Using this method we can combine multiple 32-bit values
									into a single 64-bit pointer, which allows us to read the process's entire address
									space. Finally, going beyond initial proof-of-concepts, we demonstrate end-to-end
									attacks extracting sensitive information such as the list of open pages, their
									contents, and even login credentials.

									We have tested Spook.js on Chromium, which is the basis of the Chrome browser. Thus,
									in addition to Chrome itself, we expect most Chromium-based browsers to be
									vulnerable to some variant of Spook.js. This includes recent versions of Microsoft's
									<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge</a> browser, as well as <a
										href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> which is a privacy-centered browser.
								</p>
								<p>
									Other browsers like Firefox and Safari use very different JavaScript execution
									engines, which currently stops Spook.js from working. We leave the task of
									investigating speculative exection attacks on these browsers to future work.
									Finally, Firefox has <a
										href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/05/18/introducing-site-isolation-in-firefox/">recently
										introduced</a> Strict Site Isolation in its stable release. While Spook.js does
									not work on Firefox as is, we note that similarly to Chrome, Firefox also
									consolidates pages based on their eTLD+1 domain.

									Web developers can immediately separate untrusted, user-supplied JavaScript code
									from all other content for their website, hosting all user-supplied JavaScript code
									at a domain that
									has a different eTLD+1. This way, Strict Site Isolation will not consolidate
									attacker-supplied code with
									potentially sensitive data into the same process, putting the data out of reach even
									for Spook.js as it cannot cross process boundaries.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition, sites can register their domain name to the <a
										href="https://publicsuffix.org/">Public Suffix
										List</a> (PSL). The PSL is maintained by Mozilla, and
									is a list of domains under which users can register names directly (even if the
									domains are not true top-level domains). Chrome will not consolidate pages if their
									eTLD+1 domain is present in the PSL. That is, x.publicsuffix.com and
									y.publicsuffix.com will always be separated.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, as a response to our work, Google introduced <a
										href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/07/protecting-more-with-site-isolation.html">
										Strict Extension Isolation</a>, a feature which
									prevents multiple extensions from being consolidated into the same process under memory
									pressure. This stops Spook.js (packaged as a malicious extension) from reading the
									memory of other extensions. Strict Extension Isolation is enabled as of Chrome versions 92 and up.
									We also link a <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/mitigating-side-channel-attacks.html">
									blog post</a> by Google's Chromium Project on tips for web developers to defend their sites
									against side channel attacks.
